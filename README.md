## Application Template - Angular

This project was created using HTML5, CSS3, & Angular.js.  Using 3 APIs from metacritic, youtube, and twitch, I was able to render the videos to create video game reviews of sites and the videos that would render are ordered exactly how it would turn out on youtube or twitch.


This template intended for quickly generating test-driven assignments for The Iron Yard. But you can just use it for whatever!

Includes:

* Mocha
* Chai
* Angular

## Instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

The application will be running on http://localhost:3000 and serving static assets out of /public.
